Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) and ANTLRv4 grammars are both used to describe the syntax of a programming language or data format, but they have some syntactical differences:

Syntax:
EBNF: EBNF uses symbols like ::= to define productions, and it uses punctuation symbols such as |, [], and {} to denote repetition, optional elements, and grouping.
ANTLRv4: ANTLR uses a syntax that resembles a combination of EBNF and regular expressions. It uses the : symbol to define rules, and it supports various operators like ?, *, + for optional elements, zero or more repetitions, and one or more repetitions.
Lexer and Parser Separation:
EBNF: EBNF does not explicitly distinguish between lexer and parser rules. It describes the entire grammar in terms of productions.
ANTLRv4: ANTLR separates lexer rules (token definitions) from parser rules (grammar rules). Lexer rules define individual tokens (e.g., keywords, identifiers, literals), while parser rules define the structure of the language in terms of these tokens.
Lexer Tokens:
EBNF: EBNF does not have a separate lexer phase, so it does not explicitly define lexer tokens.
ANTLRv4: ANTLR requires the explicit definition of lexer tokens using lexer rules. Each lexer rule defines a regular expression pattern corresponding to a token.
Syntactic Elements:
EBNF: EBNF supports syntactic elements such as terminals (e.g., literals, characters) and non-terminals (e.g., productions, rules).
ANTLRv4: ANTLR supports terminals (lexer rules defining tokens) and parser rules (non-terminals defining the structure of the language).
Error Handling:
EBNF: EBNF does not have built-in error handling mechanisms.
ANTLRv4: ANTLR provides error handling features such as error recovery and error reporting, which can be customized in the grammar.
Overall, while both EBNF and ANTLRv4 are used for describing grammars, ANTLRv4 offers more features and flexibility, especially in terms of separating lexer and parser phases, defining lexer tokens, and handling errors.

Here's a comparison table outlining some syntactical differences between EBNF and ANTLR4 grammars:

Please note that while EBNF and ANTLR4 have many similarities in expressing grammar rules, there are also differences in syntax and features due to the specific implementations and design choices of each formalism. This table highlights some of the common syntactical differences between the two.
