#EBNF Vs W3C EBNF Vs ANTLR4 Grammars

Here are the main differences between EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form), W3C EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form as defined by the World Wide Web Consortium), and ANTLR4 grammars:

##Syntax and Features

EBNF: EBNF is a metalanguage used to describe the syntax of programming languages and other formal languages. It consists of a set of production rules, where each rule defines how to construct valid sentences in the language being described.

W3C EBNF: W3C EBNF is an extension of EBNF specifically designed for describing the syntax of languages related to web technologies, such as XML and HTML. It includes additional features and syntax tailored for describing these languages.

ANTLR4: ANTLR4 is a parser generator that uses a syntax similar to EBNF to define grammars for parsing various languages. It includes features beyond traditional EBNF, such as lexer modes, semantic predicates, and automatic left-factoring.

##Specification

EBNF: EBNF is a general-purpose notation that has been widely adopted and used in various contexts for describing the syntax of programming languages, file formats, and other formal languages.

W3C EBNF: W3C EBNF is a specific variant of EBNF defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for describing the syntax of web-related languages, primarily XML and HTML.

ANTLR4: ANTLR4 is a parser generator tool that uses its own syntax based on EBNF to define grammars. While it follows the general principles of EBNF, it introduces some differences and extensions to support additional features provided by the ANTLR parser generator.

##Extensions and Features

EBNF: EBNF provides a basic set of features for describing the syntax of languages, including terminals, non-terminals, production rules, alternatives, repetitions, and optional elements.

W3C EBNF: W3C EBNF extends the basic EBNF syntax with additional features tailored for describing XML and HTML, such as element and attribute syntax, entity references, and content model definitions.

ANTLR4: ANTLR4 extends traditional EBNF with features such as lexer rules, lexer modes, semantic predicates, syntactic and semantic predicates, tree construction operators, and automatic left-factoring.

##Tooling

EBNF and W3C EBNF: EBNF and W3C EBNF are not tied to any specific tool or parser generator. They are used as a notation for describing language syntax and can be implemented and interpreted by various tools and systems.

ANTLR4: ANTLR4 is a specific parser generator tool that uses its own grammar syntax based on EBNF. It provides a set of tools and libraries for generating parsers and lexers from grammar specifications, along with additional features for manipulating and processing parsed input.

##Summary
In summary, EBNF and W3C EBNF are general-purpose notations for describing the syntax of languages, while ANTLR4 is a specific parser generator tool that uses its own EBNF-like syntax to define grammars and generate parsers. ANTLR4 extends traditional EBNF with additional features and tooling support for building parsers and other language processing tools.

Here's a table displaying the differences between EBNF, W3C EBNF, and ANTLR4 grammars:
